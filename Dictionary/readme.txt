I would like to aplogize for being late on this assignment. I know it is not acceptable and I take full responsibilty.

About the assignment:

In the dictionary class :
	-We have a while loop that will continue to run for as long as the input is not "x"
	-In this while  loop once one of the following letters(f, i, l, p, r, s, or x) is selected it will proceed to execute the corresponding method.
		-f :
			-this will execute the find method that asks the user for input and creates a temporary word object out of that word. The word is then used to compare as we traverse recursively  through the tree.
			- this method will return the string representation of the found word.
		-i	-this method will ask the user for a word to insert and  then we traverse the tree looking for the correct position of the word.
		-l	- we get input from the user for the file location and then loadthe tree into a text file.
		-p	-traverse the tree , printing in pre-order , each word and its meaning.
		-r	-similar to the insertion , we ask for a word to remove and we traverse the tree until we find the correct word to remove.
		-s	-In this method , we save the current tree,in a preorder fashion,  to a text file using the scanner and fileWriter objects.
